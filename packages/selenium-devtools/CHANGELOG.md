# @wdio/selenium-devtools

## 1.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 66309cf: Add the trace player. `show-trace <trace.zip>` reconstructs a recorded trace and plays it back in the dashboard with a timeline dock, filmstrip, interactive network panel, and keyboard navigation. In trace mode the adapters export a `trace.zip`; the backend reconstructs it and serves it to the player.

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [66309cf]
  - @wdio/devtools-backend@1.8.0

    - Actions within each test are wrapped in `Tracing.tracingGroup` spans for proper nesting in trace viewers
    - Fix `lastSelector` bleed-through between consecutive tests
    - Annotate tracing spans with `it()` test names
- Updated dependencies [93d3851]
